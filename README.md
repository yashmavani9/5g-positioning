<h1>5G Positioning for Early Hostage Detection</h1>

This project explores the use of 5G positioning techniques to detect potential hostage scenarios by analyzing unusual UE (User Equipment) movement patterns. Specifically, the system focuses on identifying clusters of devices that remain stationary over extended periods, which could indicate a possible hostage-like situation or restricted movement. Among various positioning techniques, Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) was selected due to its high accuracy and its capability to estimate UE locations without the need for synchronization between devices and base stations. However, due to limitations in publicly available datasets and existing simulation tools, we developed a custom Python-based generator to simulate realistic UE movement data over time. This allowed us to model different behavioral patterns in a controlled environment. For real-time analysis and visualization, we implemented a clustering-based alert system using the DBSCAN algorithm in combination with OpenCV. The system displays stationary UE clusters on a campus map, enabling authorities to take timely action in case of suspicious or emergency situations.
